In case I'm not there to brief you on the controls, and while it's pretty obvious what's going on,
here's a spec just in case.

'p' and 'P' switch between planet viewmode and spaceship respectively
'[' flips to the planet selected
']' flips to the little guy floatin around him
'+' and '-' can be used to move through the deque of planets and view whatever you like
'g' and 'G' flips between the global viewer (a camera with eye at the sun) and the local viewer (camera with eye in the orbit of the planet)
'j' and 'k' rotate your camera around the local view orbit along the xy-plane (z-coord is whatever level the planet is at)
'm' and 'M' will turn off and on the movement of the solar system (just disables and enables root->update() with a flag)

And that's all I got for now, chances are if you're reading this in the first place I'm asleep and wasn't around to explain it to you.
See you at 2PM.
