for each pixel w:			O(n)
	for each pixel h:		O(n)
		for each planet:	O(n)
			if ray intersects return intersection, which is either one or two points on sphere		O(1)
			form ray(s) from point to light		O(1)
			for each planet:		O(n)
				check if these rays intersect	O(1)
				if true color pixel, else do nothing	O(1)
				
Runtime analysis: O(n^4)

How to color pixels:
	Have each space object have vertices which need to be colored
	draw line that connects all vertices, should make shadow
	hope it works ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
